== Description ==

[File Uploads Addon for WooCommerce](https://imaginate-solutions.com/downloads/woocommerce-addon-uploads/) is a plugin for WooCommerce for enabling end users to upload custom image files while adding Products to Cart. End users or customers can upload files from WooCommerce Product pages.

Typical use cases include an online shop with a Print on demand feature where customers would upload images that would be printed on products such as Coffee Mugs, Picture Frames, T-Shirts to many other items.

The file upload feature helps store owners to capture additional information from their customers and helps to save considerable time in preparing the Order for customers without waiting for additional information that might be required.

Through this plugin, the end user or customer can upload image files needed for WooCommerce store owners to complete the order. It reduces the time needed for WooCommerce store owners doing back and forth with the customer.

The plugin has the provisions to select **WooCommerce Product Categories** for which the file upload must be available.

Uploaded file preview will be available on cart and checkout pages as well.

An Admin or a Shop Manager can view the file that has been uploaded against each order item by visiting the order details page.
